# Architecture Overview

MolPot is built as a modular pipeline with pluggable components:

- ğŸ§  `model/`: network definitions
- ğŸ“Š `dataset/`: data loading & batching
- ğŸ”§ `engine/`: trainer and loss logic
- ğŸ§ª `sim/`: simulation engine
- ğŸ”Œ `cli/`: command-line interface

Each module is independent and configurable via YAML.
